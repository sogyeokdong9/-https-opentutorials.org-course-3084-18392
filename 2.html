    <a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/" target="_blank" title="CSS Specification">CSS</a> stands for Cascading
    Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a
    document written in HTML or XML. CSS allows developers to separate the presentation of a web page from its content,
    making it easier to maintain and modify the visual appearance of the page.
  </p>

  <p>
    With CSS, developers can define the layout, fonts, colors, and other visual aspects of a web page. CSS uses
    selectors to target specific HTML elements and apply styles to them. For example, a CSS selector may target all the
    headings in a page and apply a specific font size and color to them.
  </p>

  <p>
    CSS works by cascading styles from parent elements to their child elements. This means that styles applied to a
    parent element will be inherited by its child elements, unless the child element has its own style definition that
    overrides the parent's style.
  </p>

  <p>
    CSS is widely used in web development and is an essential skill for creating modern, responsive web pages that work
    across different devices and platforms.
