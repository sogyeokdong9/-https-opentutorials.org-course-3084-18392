      title="JavaScript Specification">JavaScript</a> is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language
    used primarily for creating interactive
    web pages and web applications. It is a scripting language, which means that it is designed to be executed within a
    web browser or other host environments, such as Node.js, that provide a JavaScript runtime environment.
  </p>

  <p>
    JavaScript is used to add interactivity and behavior to web pages, enabling developers to create dynamic effects,
    respond to user actions, and manipulate web page content in real-time. With JavaScript, developers can create pop-up
    windows, drop-down menus, form validation, animations, and much more.
  </p>

  <p>
    JavaScript is a client-side language, which means that it is executed by the user's web browser and not by a server.
    This makes it a powerful tool for creating interactive and responsive user interfaces without the need for
    round-trip requests to the server.
  </p>

  <p>
    JavaScript has a syntax similar to other programming languages such as C, C++, and Java, making it easy for
    developers to learn and write code in the language. It is also supported by a wide range of web browsers and
    platforms, making it a popular choice for web development.
