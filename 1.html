    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">Hypertext Markup Language
      (HTML)</a> is a <i>markup
      language</i> used to
    create and design web
    pages.
    It consists of a set of codes or tags that define the structure and content of a web page.
    HTML code is interpreted by web browsers to display text, images, videos, and other media on the internet.
  </p>
  <p>
    HTML tags are used to define the different elements of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and
    lists.
    The tags are enclosed in angle brackets (<code>&lt;&gt;</code>) and are often paired, with the opening tag denoting
    the start of an element and the closing tag indicating its end. For example, the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag
    is
    used
    to define a paragraph, and the text within the tag is the content of the paragraph.
    The opening tag is <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and the closing tag is <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    HTML also allows web developers to add other elements to their pages, such as forms for user input, tables for
    displaying data, and multimedia content like videos and audio.
    With CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript,
    HTML can be used to create complex and interactive websites.

  <p>
    HTML is a markup language, which means it uses tags to define the structure and content of a web page.
    These tags are enclosed in angle brackets, and they provide information to the web browser about how to display the
    content.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, the following HTML code creates a heading:
  </p>

  <pre>
    &lt;h1&gt;This is a heading&lt;/h1&gt;
  </pre>

  <p>
    The h1 tag defines a heading, and the text "This is a heading" is the content of the heading.
    The closing tag(<code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code>) is used to indicate the end of the heading.
  </p>

  <p>
    HTML also allows developers to create links to other web pages, add images, and include other media types such as
    audio and video.
    Additionally, HTML provides a way to create forms that allow users to submit data, such as filling out a survey or
    making a purchase.
  </p>

  <p>
    HTML has evolved over time, with new versions introducing new features and capabilities.
    The most recent version of HTML is HTML5, which includes features such as multimedia support, improved semantic
    elements, and the ability to create more complex forms and user interfaces.
  </p>

  <p>
    In summary, HTML is a markup language used to create and structure content on the web.
    It provides a way for developers to define the elements and relationships of a web page, and it works together with
    other technologies to create dynamic and interactive web experiences.
