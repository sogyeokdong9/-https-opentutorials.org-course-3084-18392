    <strong>HTML</strong> <i>(Hypertext Markup Language)</i> is a markup language used to create and design web pages.
    It consists of a set of codes or tags that define the structure and content of a web page.
    HTML code is interpreted by web browsers to display text, images, videos, and other media on the internet.
  </p>
  <p>
    HTML tags are used to define the different elements of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and
    lists.
    The tags are enclosed in angle brackets (<code>&lt;&gt;</code>) and are often paired, with the opening tag denoting
    the start of an element and the closing tag indicating its end. For example, the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag is used
    to define a paragraph, and the text within the tag is the content of the paragraph.
    The opening tag is <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and the closing tag is <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code>.
  </p>

    HTML also allows web developers to add other elements to their pages, such as forms for user input, tables for
    displaying data, and multimedia content like videos and audio. With CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript,
    HTML can be used to create complex and interactive websites.
